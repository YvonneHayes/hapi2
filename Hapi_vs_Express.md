I liked both Express and Hapi. They are largely similar but are different enough in the details that one might prefer one over the other.

I felt it was easy enough in both of them to set up a basic CRUD framework, but creating the server seemed slightly more complicated with Hapi.

I like that Hapi has a very simple syntax for both routing and using http verbs.

I really liked that with Hapi I did not need to use the body parser.

In Hapi the routing works slightly different than in Express. Basically every route has its own object that holds all the methods, paths and handlers. This might make it look more complicated or like it's more work but I really like it. It feels like it's a real entity and I can see everything about this route right there, together, in one glance. It seemed more 'ordered' to me that way.

Overall I'd be happy using any one of these two but I'm glad I had the chance to see 'what else is out there'. :)
